### i was bored today so i wanted to remake my old 2d physics from my ball game thing because the physics there are AMAZINGLY bad.
### code uploaded isnt compilable (game is > 100 files and i lazy to upload), if you would like to compile use the .zip in releases
### i do not plan to make this a real game, but maybe one day

#### code here isnt very good and it runs horribly
#### also i just used the old 2d game as a base which is why theres options.java and wierd renderlib stuff
