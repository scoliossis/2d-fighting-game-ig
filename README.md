i was bored today so i wanted to remake my old 2d physics shit from my ball game thing because the physics there are AMAZINGLY bad.
code uploaded isnt compilable (game is > 100 files and i lazy to upload), if you would like to compile use the .zip in releases
i do not plan to make this a real game, but maybe one day
